anime-chart
===========

A JavaScript that takes in XML data (for now just an exported AniDB watched anime file), and graphs it over time using jQuery, the HighCharts Javascript library, &amp; Ash Searle's sprintf JavaScript library. For details on how to use this script, see: https://github.com/abacusleopard/anime-chart/wiki
